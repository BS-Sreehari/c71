              <p>A college canteen is a refreshment center for the students. It is necessary to have a canteen in the college premises. The food and snacks supplied by outside restaurants are usually sub standard and injurious to health. So, students can get hygienic food in the college canteen. Our college canteen is situated in the middle of the college. Students of all departments can go there whenever they need. The canteen is clean and there are a few students who remain in charge of keeping it clean. Some instructive posters are hung on the wall. Snacks of all types are sold here. Even tea, soft drinks are available here. The canteen is favorite to me because I like its clean environment and systematic service. It plays an important role in our college life. Students often discuss topics of their texts over a cup of tea in the college canteen. They thus utilize their leisure time in the canteen in a productive way.</p>
              <p>Our school also has a canteen. The canteen is very big and could accommodate many students at a time. We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to have food from the canteen, would require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during the first short recess of the day in school.

                Then, during the lunch hour, the students assemble in the canteen and they provide their coupons. Based on the coupons, the students would be given the food that they have placed their orders for. The students needs to sit in the canteen and have the food and return back the plates.</p>
